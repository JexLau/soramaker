Just look at the way the wooly mammoths connect with the ground, and their lumbering mass feels real.<p>Motion-capture works fine because that's real motion, but every time people try to animate humans and animals, even in big-budget CGI movies, it's always ultimately obviously fake. There are so many subtle things that happen in terms of acceleration and deceleration of all of the different parts of an organism, that no animator ever gets it 100% right. No animation <i>algorithm</i> gets it to a point where it's believable, just where it's \"less bad\".<p>But these videos seem to be getting it entirely believable for both people and animals. Which is <i>wild</i>.<p>And then of course, not to mention that these are entirely believable 3D spaces, with seemingly full object permanence. As opposed to other efforts I've seen which are basically briefly animating a 2D scene to make it seem vaguely 3D.",

(impressive, surpasses human/algorithmic animation thus far).<p>You're also right. There are \"tells.\" But, a tell isn't a tell until we've seen it a few times.<p>Jaron Lanier makes a point about novel technology. The first gramophone users thought it sounded identical to live orchestra.  When very early films depicting a train coming towards a camera, and people fell out of their chairs... Blurry black and white, super slow frame rate projected on a bedsheet.<p>Early 3d animation was <i>mindblowing</i> in the 90s. Now it seems like a marionette show. Well... I suppose there was a time when marionette shows were not campy. They probably looked magic.<p>It seems we need some experience before we internalize the tells and it starts to look fake. My own eye for CG images seems to improving faster then the quality. We're all learning to recognize GPT generated text. I'm sure these motion captures will look more fake to us soon.<p>That said... the fact that we're having this discussion proves that what we have here is \"novel.\" We're looking at a breakthrough in motion/animation.<p>Also, I'm not sure \"real\" is necessary. For games or film what we need is rich and believable, not real.",

They all move at 2 keyframes per second, that makes all movements seem alien and everything in an image moves strangely in sync. The dog moves in slow motion since they need more keyframes etc. That street some looks like they move in slow motion and others not.<p>People will quickly learn to notice those issues, they aren't even subtle once you are aware of them, not to mention the disappearing things etc.<p>And that wouldn't be very easy to fix, they need to train it on keyframes because training frame by frame is too much.<p>But that should make this really easy for others to replicate. You just train on keyframes and then train a model to fill in between keyframes, and you get this. It has some limitations as we see with movement keeping the same pace in every video, but there are a lot of cool results from it anyway.",

He's trained himself to spot defects and now even with the latest HEVC H.265 he finds it impossible to enjoy. It's artifacts all the way down and the work never ends.

Authoritative sources will be more valuable, but they themselves may struggle to publish only the facts and none of the fiction.<p>Here's one possible military / political use:<p>The commander of Russia's Black Sea Fleet, Viktor Sokolov,  is widely believed to have been killed by a missile strike on 22 September 2023.\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Sokolov_(naval_officer)\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Sokolov_(naval_officer)</a><p>Russian authorities refute his death and have released proof of life footage, which may be doctored or taken before his death. Authoritative source Wikipedia is not much help in establishing truth here, because without proof of death they must default to toeing the official line.<p>I predict that in the coming months Sokolov (who just yesterday was removed from his post) will re-emerge in the video realm, and go on to have a glorious career. Resurrecting dead heroes is a perfect use of this tech, for states where feeding people lies is preferable to arming them with the truth.<p>Sokolov may even go on to be the next Russian President.",

Perhaps you can cherry-pick certain DJs and make a point that they are creating a new musical composition by live-remixing the tracks they play, but even then a significant number of clubbers don't care, they just want to dance to the music. There are venues where a bunch of the audience can't even see the DJ and they still dance because they are enjoying the music on its own merits.<p>I stand by my original point. There are plenty of people who really do not care if there is a human somewhere \"performing\" the music or not. And that's totally fine.",

Some of that is already done by just chucking a smart playlist on shuffle. But then you also have up-and-comer or hobbyist DJs who will play for free in those slots, so maybe there's not really a need for a smarter computer to take over the job.<p>This whole thread started from the question of why a human should do something when a machine can do it better.

It and country are really the last genres where live traditional instruments are common during live performances.\nPop, Hip Hop, and EDM basically all are put together as being nearly computer perfect.<p>All the great producers can play instruments, and that's often times the best way to get a section out initially. But what you hear on Spotify is more and more meticulously put together note by note on a computer after the fact.<p>Live instruments on stage are now often for spectacle or worse a gimmick, and it's not the song people came to love. I think the future will have people like Lionclad[1] in it pushing what it means to perform live, but I expect them to become fewer and fewer as music just gets more complex to produce overall.<p>[1] <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuBas80oGEU\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuBas80oGEU</a>",

It's like nothing else can compare. Even if he is hysterically crying, the physical isntrument and the sound of it just makes him calm right down.<p>I wonder if something is lost in the recording process that just cannot be replicated? A live instrument is something that you can actually feel the sound of IMO, I've never felt the same with recorded music even though I of course enjoy it.<p>I wonder if when we get older we just get kind of \"bored\" (sadly) and it doesn't mean as much to us as it probably should.",

It can play the same notes in a MIDI editor with exact timing, always playing note B after 18 seconds of playing note A. Human musicians can't always be that precise in timing, but we seem to prefer how human musicians sound with all of the variations they make. We seem to dislike the precise mechanical repetition of music playback on a computer comparatively.<p>I think the same point generalises into a general dislike on the part of humans of sensory repetition. We want variety. (Compare the first and second grass pictures at [0] and you will probably find that the second which has more \"dirt\" and variety looks better.) \"Semantic satiation\" seems to be a specific case of the same tendency.<p>I'm not saying that's something a computer can't achieve eventually but it's something that will need to be done before machines can replace musicians.<p>[0] <a href=\"http://gas13.ru/v3/tutorials/sywtbapa_gradient_tool.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://gas13.ru/v3/tutorials/sywtbapa_gradient_tool.php</a>",

I've always thought it strange when news outlets discuss new deepfakes but refuse to show it, even with a watermark indicating it is fake. Misinformation research shows that people become more skeptical once they learn about the technological measures (e.g. buying karma-farmed Reddit accounts, or in the 1920s, taking advantage of dramatically lower newspaper printing costs to print sensationalism) through which misinformation is manufactured.",

And we can see one of the archeologists basically chasing the chair down to grab it, which does correctly model the interaction with a floating object.<p>I think we can't underestimate how crucial that is to the building of a general model that has a strong model of the world. Not just a \"theory of mind\", but a litteral understanding of \"what will happen next\", independently of \"what would a human say would happen next\" (which is what the usual text-based models seem to do).<p>This is going to be much more important, IMO, than the video aspect.",

Perhaps Sora can handle these, but I suspect it is mimicking the usual world rather than understanding physics in any strong sense.<p>None of which is to say their accomplishment isn't impressive.

However the Chinese room is supposed to \"behaves as if it understands Chinese\" and can engage in a conversation (let us assume via text). To do this the room must \"remember\" previously mentioned facts, people, etc. Furthermore it must line up ambiguous references correctly (both in reading and writing).<p>As we now know from more than 60 years of good old fashioned AI efforts, plus recent learning based AI, this CAN be done using computers but CANNOT be done using just ordinary if - then - else type rules no matter how complicated. Searle wrote before we had any systems that could actually (behave as if they) understood language and could converse like humans, so he can be forgiven for failing to understand this.<p>Now that we do know how to build these systems, we can still imagine a Chinese room. The little guy in the room will still be \"following pre-written scripted algorithmic procedures.\" He'll have archives of billions of weights for his \"dictionary\". He will have to translate each character he \"reads\" into one or more vectors of hundreds or thousands of numbers, perform billions of matrix multiplies on the results, and translate the output of the calculations -- more vectors -- into characters to reply. (We may come up with something better, but  the brain can clearly do something very much like this.)<p>Of course this will take the guy hundreds or thousands of years from \"reading\" some Chinese to \"writing\" a reply. Realistically if we use error correcting codes to handle his inevitable mistakes that will increase the time greatly.<p>Implication: Once we expand our image of the Chinese room enough to actually fulfill Searle's requirements, I can no longer imagine the actual system concretely, and I'm not convinced that the ROOM ITSELF \"doesn't have a mind\" that somehow emerges from the interaction of all these vectors and weights.<p>Too bad Searle is dead, I'd love to have his reply to this.",

In some capacity, military commanders are tasked with it on a regular basis (with varying degrees of success).<p>With the capabilities described above, why couldn't the AI find and exploit weaknesses in the enemy's key infrastructure (digital and real-world) and people?

If you see things this way, data-efficiency comparisons are more appropriate in the context of learning a new task or piece of information, and foundation models tend to do this quite well.<p>Additionally, most of the energy cost comes from pretraining, but once we have the resulting weights, downstream fine-tuning or inference are comparatively quite cheap. So even if the energy cost is high, it may be worth it if we get powerful generalist models that we can specialize in many different ways.<p>> This is why we invented math and physics studies, to be able to accurately calculate, predict and reproduce those events.<p>We won't do away without those, but an intuitive understanding of the world can go a long way towards knowing when and how to use precise quantitative methods.",

Similarly, how many videos looking out a train window do you think it's seen where there was not a reflection of a person in the window when it's dark?",

The congruency however needs to extend to more than 2 generations. If a single scene is composed of multiple shots, then those multiple shots need to be part of the same world the scene is being shot in.\nIf you check the video with the title `A beautiful homemade video showing the people of Lagos, Nigeria in the year 2056. Shot with a mobile phone camera.` the surroundings do not seem to make sense as the view starts with a market, spirals around a point and then ends with a bridge which does not fit into the market. \nIf the the different shots generated the model did fit together seamlessly, trying to make the fit together is where the difficulty comes in.

They are preposterously HARD to replace, in theatre and film. A good actor is worth their weight in gold. Very very few people are good actors. A good actor is a good comedian, a master at controlling his body, and a master at controlling his voice, towards a specifically intended goal. They can make you laugh, cry, sigh, or feel just about anything. You just look at Paul Giamatti or Willem Dafoe or Denzel Washington. Those people are not replaceable, and their work is just as good and just as culturally important as a Picasso or a Monet. A hundred years from now people will know the name of actors, because that was the dominant mode of entertainment of our age.",

But looking into their technical paper, it is evident that they are benefiting from their own body of work done in the past and also the enormous resources available to them.<p>For instance, the generational leap in video generation capability of SORA may be possible because:<p>1. Instead of resizing, cropping, or trimming videos to a standard size, Sora trains on data at its native size. This preserves the original aspect ratios and improves composition and framing in the generated videos. This requires massive infrastructure. This is eerily similar to how GPT3 benefited from a blunt approach of throwing massive resources at a problem rather than extensively optimizing the architecture, dataset, or pre-training steps.<p>2. Sora leverages the re-captioning technique from DALL-E 3 by leveraging GPT to turn short user prompts into longer detailed captions that are sent to the video model. Although it remains unclear whether they employ GPT-4 or another internal model, it stands to reason that they have access to a superior captioning model compared to others.<p>This is not to say that inertia and resources are the only factors that is differentiating OpenAI, they may have access to much better talent pool but that is hard to gauge from the outside.",

For example, a person might take a bite out of a cookie, but afterward, the cookie may not have a bite mark.</i><p>>> <i>Similar to GPT models, Sora uses a transformer architecture, unlocking superior scaling performance.</i><p>>> <i>We represent videos and images as collections of smaller units of data called patches, each of which is akin to a token in GPT. By unifying how we represent data, we can train diffusion transformers on a wider range of visual data than was possible before, spanning different durations, resolutions and aspect ratios.</i><p>>> <i>Sora builds on past research in DALL·E and GPT models. It uses the recaptioning technique from DALL·E 3, which involves generating highly descriptive captions for the visual training data. As a result, the model is able to follow the user’s text instructions in the generated video more faithfully.</i><p>The implied facts that it understands physics of simple scenes and any instances of cause and effect are impressive!<p>Although I assume that's been SotA-possible for awhile, and I just hadn't heard?",

While we understand that we're on the exponential curve of AI progress, it's always hard to intuit just what that means.<p>Sora represents a monumental leap forward, it's comically a 3000% improvement in 'coherent' video generation seconds. Coupled with a significantly enhanced understanding of contextual prompts and overall quality, it's has achieved what many (most?) thought would take another year or two.<p>I think we will see studios like ILM pivoting to AI in the near future. There's no need for 200 VFX artists when you can have 15 artists working with AI tooling to generate all the frame-by-frame effects, backgrounds, and compositing for movies. It'll open the door for indie projects that can take place in settings that were previously the domain of big Hollywood. A sci-fi opera could be put together with a few talented actors, AI effects and a small team to handle post-production. This could conceivably include AI scoring.<p>Sure, Hollywood and various guilds will strongly resist but it'll require just a handful of streaming companies to pivot. Suddenly content creation costs for Netflix drops an order of magnitude. The economics of content creation will fundamentally change.<p>At the risk of being proven very wrong, I think replacing actors is still fairly distant in the future but again... humans are bad at conceptualizing exponential progress.",

          "text": "Do you feel the same way about modern movies? CGI is so ubiquitous and accessible, that most movies use some form of it. It's actually news when a filmmaker _doesn't_ use CGI (e.g. Nolan).<p>These advancements are just the next step in that evolution. The tech used in movies will be commoditized, and you'll see Hollywood-style production in YouTube videos.<p>I'm not sure why you think theater will become _more_ popular because of this. It has remained popular throughout the years, as technology comes and goes. People can enjoy both video and theater, no?",

Same for local live musicians.<p>That said, I helped a friend who makes low budget, edgy and cool films last week. I showed him what I knew about driving Pika.art and he picked it up quickly. He is very excited about the possibility of being able to write more stories and turn them into films.<p>I think there is plenty of demand for all kinds of entertainment. It is sad that so many creative people in Hollywood and other content creation centers will lose jobs. I think the very best people will be employed, but often partnered with AIs. Off topic, but I have been a paid AI practitioner since 1982, and the breakthroughs of deep learning, transformers, and LLMs are stunning.",

More than anything else, he craves being important. The unraveling of his motivations and where they come from <i>is</i> the story, and that's something you can't really do when you're literally watching yourself shoehorned into a fictional setting.<p>You seem to regard it as self-evident that art or entertainment would be improved if (1) it's all about you personally and (2) involvement of other real humans is reduced to zero, but I cannot fathom why you would think that (with the exception of the porn example).",

If I hire you do to work for me, you're not improving my individual skills. I am not more employable as a result of me outsourcing my labour to you, I am less employable. Anyone who wants something done would go to you directly, there's no need to do business through me.<p>This is why you won't be employable because the same applies to AI – why would I ask you to ask an AI to complete a task when I can just ask the AI myself?<p>The end result here is that only the people with access to AI at scale will be able to do anything. You might have access to the AI, but you can't create resources with a chatbot on your computer. Only someone who can afford an army of machines powered by AI can do this. Any manufacturing problem, any amount of agricultural work, any service job – these can all done by those with resources independently of any human labourers.<p>At best you might be able to prompt an AI to do service work for you, but again, if anyone can do this, you'd have to question why anyone would ask you to do it for them. If I want to know the answer to 13412321 * 1232132, I don't ask a calculator prompter, I just find the answer myself. The same is true of AI. Your labour is worthless.

Base survival, maintaining your home, caring for family and friends, improving quality of life - there's plenty of demand there and work to do.  The cost to deliver that demand will demonstrably be far lower than it ever has been with these new tools.   Would you be able to hire that labor out to corporate AIs for even cheaper in absolute costs due to the benefits of mass production?  Sure.  But providing these things is a job for you too and it's \"free\" with just a bit of time and effort.<p>Tinkering with open source tools to assemble your first robot kit out of older hardware and 3D printed materials is not going to be prohibitively expensive.  The cost to train it - probably not either, if the massive efficiencies we keep finding in models keep lowering and the community keeps sharing model tweaks.  Make one robot with good enough dexterity and your second bot is a hell of a lot easier to make.  These aren't going to take some ridiculously unheard-of materials or manufacturing processes.  In fact, cheap AI chip alternatives to GPUs can be built on decades-old architectures designed to just maximize matrix multiplication with much simpler manufacturing.  Monopolizing scarcities here isn't a sure bet.  We've just been waiting for a good general-purpose brain.  We have it now - and every bit of information we expose it to, the easier it gets to do anything with it.<p>Unless the big fancy AI wielders are coming for you with killer drones by then, this is all stuff people are going to be well-capable of while unemployed and living off food stamps, savings, or remortgaged houses.  If they don't have the skills personally, they'll turn to friends and family who do and find mutual tribal support in tough times as people always do.  Growing your own food, building your own infrastructure - all have been doable for a while, but are about to get stupidly easy with a few bots and helpful AI guidance.  Normal humanity will carry on and pick up the pieces just fine in this new Dark Age, even as the corporates take the open field opportunity to chase for riches beyond our comprehension, mining asteroids and claiming the solar system.<p>Now imagine if those greedy corporates happened to just throw the rest of us a bone - 1% of their exponentially-increasing profits - as a PR gesture.  Still would soon become far more wealth in absolute terms than the common people have ever seen in the history of earth.<p>If you think none of that is going to happen, then the alternative is a lot closer to the first people with AGI simply scouring the earth in a paranoid culling.   Sure, it's entirely possible.  But it takes a certain Next Level of Evil to make that happen.<p>And all that aside - if you really want to play up the capitalist dystopia angle, there's still plenty of individual value to be mined from people via a wage.  Memory and preference mining, medical testing, AI fidelity comparison - plenty of reasons to pay people a little bit to steal what's left of their souls for even further improvement of AI.  Might be enough for them to afford their first robots, even.<p>But by all means - go destroy corporate AI data centers if you think you can get away with it.  Anything to tip the scales towards public / open source AI keeping up.  But this tech is not going away, nor should it.  It could very well result in unprecedented abundance for all, so long as things don't go ridiculously extremist.",

If AI simply causes ~10%-20% of middle class workers to fall into the lower class as you suggest then I'd agree it won't be the end of the world. But if the optimistic outcome here is the near-term people won't be \"totally unemployable\" because people who lose their jobs can always join the working class then I'd still rather bomb the data centers.<p>If we're a little more aggressive and assume 50% of the middle class will lose their jobs in the next 10-20 years then in my opinion this is not as easy as just reskilling people to do manual labour.<p>Firstly, you're just assuming that all these middle class workers are going to be happy with being forced into the lower class – they won't be and again this isn't a desirable outcome.<p>You're also not considering the fact that this huge influx of labour competing for these crappy manual labour jobs will make them even less desirable than they already are. I keep hearing people say how they're going to reskill as a plumber / electrician when AI takes their job as if there is an endless demand for these workers. Horses still have some niche uses, but for the most part they're useless. This is far more likely to be the future of human labour. Even if plumbers are one of the few jobs humans will be able to do in a post-AI world then the supply of them will almost certainly far exceed demand. The end result of this excess supply is that plumbers going to be paid crap and mostly be unemployed.<p>I think you're also underestimating how fast fields like robotics could advance with AI. The primary reason robotics suck is because of a lack of intelligence. We can build physically flexible machines that have decent battery lives already – Spot as an example. The issue is more that we can't currently use them for much because they're not intelligent enough to solve useful problems. At best we can code / train them to solve very niche problems. This could change rapidly in the coming years as AI advances.<p>Even the optimistic outcomes here are god awful, and the ultimate risks compound with time.<p>We either stop the AI or we become the AI. That's the decision we have to make this decade. If we don't we should assume we will be replaced with time. If I'm correct I feel we should be alarmist. If I am wrong, then I'd love for someone to convince me that humans are special and irreplaceable.",

But I think you're grossly under-estimating the vastness of human endeavors, ingenuity, and resilience. Ultimately we're still talking about the bottom falling out of the creative arts: storytelling, images, movies, even porn -- all of that is about to be incredibly easy to create mediocre versions of.

Yes, many of those industries may also get replaced by AI one day, and rapidly at that, but not by ChatGPT or Sora.<p>Of course you're right that our near future may suddenly be an AI company hegemony, replacing the current tech hegemony, which replaced the physical retail hegemony, which replaced the manufacturing hegemony, which replaced the railway hegemony, which replaced the slave-owning plantation hegemony, which replaced the guilds hegemony, which replaced the ...<p>You're also under-estimating how much business can actually be relocated outside the U.S., and also how much revolution can be wrought by a completely disenfranchised generation.",

How many multi-million-dollar funded startups did this just absolutely obsolete?<p>For posterity since the term has been misused lately, having a very good product isn't a moat in the business sense. There's nothing stopping a competitor from creating a similar product (even if it's difficult), and there's nothing currently stopping OpenAI's users from switching from using Sora to a sufficient competitor if it exists.<p>Sora is more akin to a company like Apple/Google a decade ago using their vast resources to do what a third-party does, but better (e.g. the Sherlocked incident: <a href=\"https://www.howtogeek.com/297651/what-does-it-mean-when-a-company-sherlocks-an-app/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.howtogeek.com/297651/what-does-it-mean-when-a-co...</a>).",

Having the best product and being able to maintain that best-in-class product status over time through a firm's 'internal capabilities' is very much <i>a</i> moat and a strong one at that. A moat is the business strategy sense is anything that enables a firm to maintain competitive advantage. Having the best product in a category, and being able to maintain that over releases is a strong competitive advantage (especially when there is high willingness to pay or price is a strong competitive dimension compared to the value created).",

We see this in off-patent drugs, where it may have 200X margins but no competitor will go through the FDA manufacturing reapproval process because they won't actually get those margins if they begin competing on price, and then the sunk cost of getting to the competitive level isn't worth anything for them.<p>I think OpenAI's big moats are in userbase feedback and just proprietary trade knowledge after they stopped sharing model details.  They may have made some exclusive data source deals with book/textbook and other publishers,  though it isn't clear a license is actually needed for that until things work through the courts.",

It shifted our relationship to knowledge; instead of having to employ an expert in looking things up, we all had to become experts at sifting through a flood of info.<p>When the cost of producing art-directed and realistic video goes to zero it's hard to predict what's going to happen. Obviously the era of video = veracity is now over. And you can get the equivalent of Martin Scorsese and a million dollar budget to do the video instructions for a hair dryer. Instead of hunting for a gif to express how you feel, captured from an existing TV show or something, you could create a scene on the fly and attach it to a text message. Or maybe you dispense with text messages altogether. Maybe text is only for talking to computers now.<p>My personal prediction is that the value of a degree in art history is going to go way, way up, because they'll be the best prompt engineers.

Actors can be generated to represent a local minority that is villainized by politicians and the clothing and set customized for the locale.<p>Then you can automate posting it all over social media with fake AI generated discussions calling for a revolution. Even if the video gets flagged as fake, you can upload a thousand more. As a bonus, add comments along the lines of \"of course THEY want you to think this is fake!

Minutes will be like an eternity, and days, let alone years, will be beyond that.<p>Trusting such a small number of people with that kind of power is obscene, especially when history has time and time again shown what humans do to things which are no longer useful to them.<p>There has never been a divide like humans w access to AGI and regular humans before.  It will be greater than the difference between a human with a modern cell phone and a carrier pigeon -- the pigeon itself, not a human using it.<p>My money is on the cord being cut.

Either we're being fed a worldwide false reality bubble, or there's a plethora of low-hanging fruit being discovered daily from just a few foundational model finds, and even though the big firms are gonna scoop those up first it's gonna be pretty hard to ever hide that information for long<p>Of course they're gonna get a few years heads start - which will feel like centuries in AGI time - but either they wipe us all out during that, or we're gonna put the garbage together and make our own AGI too.",

          "text": "I think of it like: The only reason humans still drive cars is we have yet to find a good enough way of replacing ourselves with something more effective. It's merely an implementation detail of \"getting from A to B\" that would be disrupted if a true autonomous solution was discovered. Many would want to optimize away drunk drivers and road rage if it were possible in some faraway future. So something like a steering wheel could be seen like a compromise of sorts, until the next big thing makes them obsolete.<p>That, and the state of missing a technology in a period of time is irreplaceable once it's been discovered. Nobody can live in an era without social media anymore, barring a global-scale catastrophic reset. So I believe it's important to consider what technology is not yet totally pervasive, for example by realizing there is still a steering wheel for you to grip in your car.<p>And in my mind, the sinister feeling stems from the fact that all it takes to irreversibly shift society like that is enough smart people with honest intentions but little foresight of what will happen in a few decades as a result of proliferating all this. The problems that result stop being in anyone's control, \"throwing it over the wall\" so to speak, and instead become yet another fact of life that could weigh us down (mostly I think of the ubiquity of social media and how it has changed human interaction). And it all stems from just a few engineering type people getting overexcited about cool possibilities they can grasp at, not considering there are billions of people unlike them who may have other ideas.",

It's not just about the end result; people still go to concert on top of listening to studio recordings for example, and people still watch humans play chess even though it's clear that good enough algorithms can beat the best humans easily. Technology like these which takes away too much immediate effort (hours needed to create the product) and long term effort (decades of training) are inherently absent of underlying value that I spoke of. Of course, if a person is only interested in consumption, it matters not how the \"thing\" is created.<p>Much of the sense of doom I have comes from the inherent erosion of this human effort element in the creative process. Whether we like it or not, the availability of mass produced content naturally threatens crafts themselves. After all, nobody wants to spend a few decades on their skills only to have their creation compared to an AI generated image produced in a few seconds.<p>I understand there are a lot of hypes around these technology to \"humanity\" but I have yet to see it. It just feels like more power consolidation to billionaires (especially when done as ClosedAI). There are artists who have tried to incorporate these but they have always felt the need to willingly not label their work as AI-generated or AI-assisted to sell (but still leaves in enough details for keen observers to tell it's AI touched).<p>As a whole, it just feels wrong. The most optimistic (and reasonable) take I have seen is \"Just wait and see\". It might feel like a non-argument, but it's the only realistic take between the hyped up techbros and the doomer cult (admittedly, I might belong to the latter group).<p>I think one of the most worrying thing for me is that regardless of how this plays out, this technology has only added more complexity to our society. That people are divided into camps about how they feel about the technology is simply a symptom about how much uncertainty there is in the future. This last bit will be a personal quarrel, but I personally lose any last desire to have children seeing the AI advancement. It's not right creating sentient life in an age where every year people have to play lottery to see whether technological advancement has deemed their life long effort unworthy.",

There's a HUGE amount of creative accessories around them to manipulate and steer the process. There might be less creativity needed with the pen, but it's needed in other ways.",

With generative ai you’re simply going one step further and have another new tool create a more polished version that you can edit to remove extra fingers, etc. It’s simply moving the baseline from 20% done to 60% done, which will result in artists producing even higher fidelity and more detailed art.<p>For example an artist could generate a bunch of scenes using Sora and create a collage of them for a larger piece of art, something that is prohibitively time consuming right now.",

Nobody is mentioning the magical fairy dust in human brains that makes us superior to these models. When I really like fantasy novels, and then train my neurons on thousands of hours of reading Tolkien, Terry Brooks, Brandon Sanderson, etc, and then I get the idea to write my own fantasy series, my creative process doesn't draw on my own model's training data at all. It's 100% \"creative\", and I would produce exactly the same content if I were illiterate. But these goddamned machines, man. They don't have our special human fairy dust.<p>When we discovered the universal law of gravitation, and realized that the laws of physics are omnipresent in our universe, we put a giant asterisk to note that the laws of physics are different inside humans. The epidermis is a sort of barrier to physics, and within its confines, magic happens, that these pro-AI people conveniently \"forget\".<p>To paraphrase the eminent Human Unique Creative Person Roger Penrose: \"There's magical quantum shit goin down in the microtubules.

A machine cannot, and it’s increasingly looking like the companies that operate the machines can’t either.<p>150 years ago, Bertha Benz wasn't allowed to own property or patents in her own right, because the law said so.<p>The specific reason a machine cannot be held responsible today is because the law says so.<p>Also, dead humans' copyright is respected in law, so \"alive\" isn't adding value to your argument here.<p>> I also can’t churn out my inspired works at a rate that displaces potentially everyone who has ever influenced me.<p>I can't run faster than every athlete who has ever inspired me, this argument does not prevent motor cars.<p>I can't write notes faster than the world record holder in shorthand, this argument does not prevent the printing press.<p>I can't play chess or go at even a mediocre level, this argument does not prevent Stockfish or Alpha Go.<p>I can't hear the tonal differences in Chinese well enough to distinguish \"hello\" from \"mud trench\", 这个论点并没有阻止谷歌翻译学习 “你好” 和 “泥壕” 之间的区别。<p>I can't do arithmetic in my head faster than literally all other humans combined even if they hadn't been trained to the level of the current world record holder, this argument does not prevent the original model of the Raspberry Pi Zero.<p>\"The machine is 'better', in one or more senses of the word, than a human\" is, in fact, <i>a reason to use the machine</i>. It's <i>the</i> reason to use a machine. It's <i>why the machine is an economic threat</i> — but you can't just use \"my income is threatened by this machine\" as a reason to prevent other people using the machine, just as I as a software developer can't use that argument to stop other people using LLMs to write code without hiring me.<p>> Cinema did not eliminate theatre just as records did not eliminate live music. In fact, both are arguably as big now as they have ever been.<p>You can argue that, but you'd be wrong.<p>Shakespeare wrote for normal everyday people, his stuff fit into the category that today would be \"TV soap opera\", where the audience was everyone rather than just the well-off, where the only other public entertainment was options were bear-baiting and public executions, where the actors have very little time to rehearse, and where \"you're ripping off my ideas\" was handled by rapidly churning out new content.<p>Live music, without amplification, used to be the <i>only</i> way to listen to music. Now, even if you see a live performance, you can have 10k people in a single venue listening to a single band… and if you want music in a pub or a dance club, the most likely performance is from a DJ rather than a band, and the \"D\" stands for \"disk\" because the actual content is pre-recorded — and that's not to say I would deny that DJ work is \"creative\", but rather that it makes DJing exactly what critics accuse GenAI of being, remixing of other people's work.<p>Which, now I think about it, is a description that would also apply to all the modern performances of Shakespeare: simply reusing someone else's creation without paying any compensation to the estate.<p>But I know that will tickle you the wrong way, I know that art is the peacock's tail of humans: the struggle, the difficulty, is the point, and it has to be because that's how we find people to start families with. Because of that, GenAI is like being caught wearing a fake Rolex watch, and you can't <i>actually</i> defend that with logical reasons such as \"real Rolex watches aren't very good at keeping time compared to even a Casio F-91W let alone the atomic clock synchronising with my phone\", because logic isn't the point, and never was the point.",

It also means a lot of uncertainty for the immediate future. If AI takes over my job, will I still be able to compete in some industry somewhere and provide for myself?<p>I understand this fear, and sympathise with it even though I have multiple income streams.<p>> I don't want much out of life, but I do want the ability to influence my own personal situation. If we wind up in the UBI-ified, dense urban housing future where AI does all the work and no one owns anything, how much real influence will I have over my life?<p>Why do you fear \"dense\" urban housing future? I think most people <i>choose</i> relatively dense environments because that's where all the stuff they want is, but rural areas are cheaper[0], and the kind of future where humans <i>must</i> live on UBI due to lack of economic opportunity is necessarily one where robots do the manual labor such as house building and civil engineering, not just the intellectual jobs like architecture and practicing real estate law.<p>Likewise, while I can see several possible futures where nobody owns stuff, the tech to make it happen is necessarily also good enough that any random philanthropist who owns just one tiny autofac would find it trivial to give everyone their own personal autofac — \"my first wish is infinite wishes\" except the magic gene doesn't say \"no\".<p>[0] The only reason I'm looking to get somewhere a bit more rural is that the sound insulation in my current place is failing, and I'm right by a busy junction with multiple emergency vehicles passing each day — and the more less built-up areas are the cheap ones.

My concern isn’t really remotely about any of the accomplishments of generative AI. Frankly in my daily life I’d welcome readily available access. As it stands now it’s sort of a mixture of analytics and creativity without consciousness as we best understand it, so GPT itself isn’t going to murder me and take over the world.<p>The real issue is who owns these things, how you access them, how effects will ripple through a labor based economy, and how we’ll adapt (or not) our current economic system. As it stands for awhile we’ve been catering to the capital ownership group. If that doesn’t have a change in direction then I fear the implications of much of this in daily life. There’s still a fair bit of specialization and domain knowledge needed to leverage these tools to understand the questions to ask (I.e prompts to generate both around LLMs and the context of information fed to them)  but they can certainly in many cases behave as multipliers that could reduce the amount of staff needed in some creative roles or eliminate some all together.<p>This isnt a new dilemma as arguably technology has been shifting the labor market for centuries, the question is how and if it can reshape well this time or if we need to fundamentally rethink these concepts of labor and capital ownership.

Maximalist liberty as a universal moral value can be derived from the dual axioms of universal moral equality and a lack of moral oracle. If you accept these axioms, it follows that there is no source of moral authority that can legitimately constrain the non-infringing actions of another (eg. your right to wave your fists around ends where my nose begins). These ideas were first laid out in The Declaration of the Rights of Man, and expanded on in the Declaration of Independence.<p>> <i>What are you actually trying to say?</i><p>That the causal chain of an action is completely interrupted at the first agent/actor in the system, who bears full responsibility for their actions.<p>> <i>justice systems almost universally</i><p>It very much depends on the justice system. If you look at US/British/Roman law, a guilty mind (<i>mens rea</i>) and a guilty action (<i>actus reus</i>) are core facts that must be established in order to prove a crime has been committed. These still apply in cases of eg. criminal negligence, where a reasonable person ought to have known that their actions will result in harm. <i>Mens rea</i> is quite challenging to prove in cases of incitement, and legal precedents vary.<p>In combination with the above causal thesis, I hold that restricting incitement is in all cases an overstep of federal authority and an infringement of fundamental liberty. Incitement as a crime seems to have been established to make policing easier, not because telling someone to do something makes you responsible for their actions.<p>> <i>you were negligent in your creation and distribution of propaganda</i><p>People are not inanimate objects. They are decision-making agents. The world is not a Rube-Goldberg machine. The soldiers who do the killing are responsible for their own moral attitude, and their own actions. You cannot be reasonably expected to know how your ideas will impact the minds of others, since every mind is a black box. Everything that contradicts this does so with generalizations too broad to be predictively useful.<p>> <i>You can similarly take a small next step</i><p>This is where everything goes insane. Where does the responsibility end? You're trying to piece the butterfly effect back together.<p>Are people who make and sell bullets responsible for shootings? What about those that refine brass and lead? What about those that mine for ore? Creating economic demand, or promoting an idea, are morally neutral actions. People buying goods are in no way responsible for the conditions of their manufacture. People promoting ideas are in no way responsible for the actions a listener may take. Responsibility is zero-sum. Don't allow slavers and murderers to dispense with even a tiny portion of the sum responsibility for their actions. They must bear it all.",

Yet, I can't help but ponder over the peculiar ballet of human ingenuity and mechanical precision. Consider for a moment, this strange juncture we find ourselves at, a place where the tools crafted by our own hands begin to sketch the outlines of what could very well be new breeds of creativity.<p>Let's muse on the notion that creativity, as we've known and cherished it, can be bottled up and dispensed by machines, up to a certain whimsical point. Beyond that? We stumble upon creations like these, novel tools that beckon us, the flesh-and-blood creators, to mold unforeseen \"creativities.\" It's one spectacle to mechanize the known realms of artistic endeavor, quite another to boldly claim that machines shall inherit the mantle of creativity, henceforth dictating the contours of all future artistic landscapes.<p>History, that grand tapestry, is peppered with instances where the mechanical muses have dared to tread upon the sacred grounds of creativity. Take photography, for instance, a marvel of the 19th century that promised to capture reality with an accuracy that scoffed at the painter's brush. Or consider the digital revolution, which flung open the doors to realms of visual and auditory experiences previously consigned to the realm of dreams. The synthesizer, not merely an instrument but a portal, has ushered us into a new era of musical exploration, challenging the supremacy of the acoustic tradition.<p>Each of these milestones, while distinctly modern, echoes the age-old dance between creator and tool, where each step forward is both a continuation and a departure from the past. In this light, the question isn't whether creativity can be automated, but rather how our definition of creativity evolves as we, hand in hand with our mechanical counterparts, stride into the unknown.",

People get all whimsical when I bring this up and say \"but what about the [spirit/feelings/blah]. I'm clear eyed about it though. If I could go back & re-roll my character sheet (i.e. slap my younger self into realizing STEM is cool while those doors were still open), I certainly would.<p>However, there's a line somewhere. I've spent most of my life around drab midwestern utilitarian/corporate/commercial buildings, and it has been noticeably depressing. In the periods where I've spent time in beautiful buildings, I have felt much better. Based on anecdata, I'm not the only one. There's something important & essential for humans about ornamentation & beauty. It's more than entertainment.<p>Humans can live on rice and kidney beans, but if one must do so <i>without hope for more tasty options[0]</i> it is demoralizing.<p>[0] lots of people are happy with spartan diets, but most often those people are doing so by choice.<p>H",

Despite millions of artists, animators, etc. all being resoundly opposed to AI art, the models that infringe their work are still allowed to exist, and it seems they're fighting a losing battle.<p>A lot of people are being \"hysterical\" because a lot of people <i>don't</i> have a choice.<p>To be clear, the problem of these scenarios is tightly intertwined with the problem of unfettered capitalism and wealth inequality in general.  Food and shelter require money, and we get money by working a job. If millions of jobs disappear overnight, then of course millions of people are going to be distressed over no longer having ready access to food and shelter.<p>The idea of \"just getting another job\" doesn't scale to the destruction of entire industries employing tens of millions of people.  This is how depressions are made.<p>The idea of \"the depression will end someday\" is not only not necessarily true as wealth inequality skyrockets, but is also cold comfort to the people who will lose their houses and for some, lives, due to the disruption.<p>A different economic system could perhaps allow us to appreciate these technological advances without worrying about them displacing our ability to live. But the American political system consistently and firmly rejects any ideas not rooted in social darwinist capitalism.<p>For your sake, I hope your resume is <i>very</i> impressive.",

Perhaps we could socialize these costs, but we don't and are unlikely to do so.<p>Another issue to look at is the lack of ownership of the tools of your trade. In a context where many use AI models to competitively produce, hosts of AI models essentially own the access to your trade - thereby able to charge a toll, or privilege certain behaviors for any who strive to make living with these tools. (of  course this is happening now with plenty of software products). The ultimate trajectory of this is not democratization of a toolset, but a transfer of wealth from labor to capital. And keep in mind that the labor share of income has been steadily declining for half a century.<p>The creation of wealth from AI ultimately depends on the strength of democratic and pluralistic institutions that safeguard ownership of your trade, democratized access to capital, and safeguards of welfare in the environment of creative destrcution.

If one person can day (8 hours) making a shoe by hand, and one person can make a shoe in an hour using a shoe making machine, then we don't have one less shoe maker, we have two people making 16 shoes a day. As an effect, shoes are now much cheaper, so they aren't only worn by rich people. If the one-shoe-per-day maker refuses to use a shoe making machine, he or she can upsell their 'hand crafted' shoes to rich people who want to distinguish themselves.<p>Believe me, I am not a 'free market fixes everything' person, at all, but in these cases, that is how it has worked since the industrial revolution. This is not a new process (automation making a task much more accessible/efficient) and this is not a new complaint (what happens to the people who made a living doing task).<p>Change is scary -- and everyone has the right to be afraid of an uncertain future, but I can't recall an instance of the regressive approach actually working to allay the fears of those who imposed it.

The difference between that and what OpenAI is doing is just degrees of abstraction, either way they're deriving value from others work without compensating them, and actively undermining the ongoing creation of the work they're appropriating, while simultaneously relying on the ongoing creation of that work to keep feeding their machine.<p>IP law has yet to decide whether my interpretation of the situation is correct in the legal sense, but I find it impossible to see \"ChatGPT absorbs the work of writers/journalists and sells a superficially reworded version without attribution or compensation\" as anything but theft obfuscated behind lots of fancy math.

What a great toolset! For what you've had to have army of people, freezing ass on location, working with actors.. soon gone. Well, if you want it to. On the other hand, look at what happened to imagery, concept art in general. For the better part it cheapened it. Turned it into this mass produced, easily available thing that it's not special anymore. Skills are still needed to produce exactly what you want, but the special flair is kind of gone. It will need way more energy and creativity now to stand out.",

Whether it is the way the dog walks out into space or the clawlike hand of the woman in Tokyo, they are still uncanny valley to me. I'm not going to watch a movie made this way, even if it costs my $0.15 instead of $15.00. But I got tired of Avatar after watching it for 20 minutes. Maybe all the artificial abundance and intellectual laziness the generative AI world will make us realize how precious and beautiful the real world is. For my kids' sake, I hope so.",

Nor have people stopped pursuing other hobbies impacted by AI. We don't go to museums to look at AI art that was created in 10 seconds and I doubt culture will shift to a point where that's common place. Human content will still be created, and we will probably see the general quality of that content increase as a result of foundational models. Content creation is taking whats in the mind and translating it into the physical/digital realm. With better AI, this translation becomes easier for a lot of fields and you no longer have to master the use devices to make your art quality. However, everyone can agree that prompt based generation is a lot less satisfying than making content from scratch. It feels more akin to a google search than a satisfying creative process. Those who are passionate and talented will continue to pursue their physical medium because of this.<p>The monetary value of generic stock content will surely drop and won't be created by professionals anymore. However, that doesn't mean people stop taking pictures of their dog just because they can get midjourney to generate the same thing. Creation for the sake of creation will continue. AI companies will initially reap in a lot of the $ value that used to go to the creators of stock content, but when open source models reach parity the masses will be able to make what's in their mind a reality as casual creators. Hobbyists will still exist and those that become truly great will still rise to notoriety.",

These things will obviously improve as time marches on.<p>The fear I have has less to do with these taking jobs, but in that eventually this is just going to be used by a foreign actor and no one is going to know what is real anymore. This already exists in new stories, now imagine that with actual AI videos that are near indistinguishable from reality. It could get really bad. Have an insane conspiracy theory? Well, now you can have your belief validated by a completely fictional AI generated video that even the most trained eyes have trouble debunking.<p>The jobs thing is also a concern, because if you have a bunch of idle hands that suddenly aren't sure what to believe or just believe lies, it can quickly turn into mass political violence. Don't be naive to think this isn't already being thought of by various national security services and militaries.

      "text": "Here is my prediction of how this will play out for the entertainment industry in the coming decades:<p>Phase 1 (we are here now): While generative AI is not good enough to directly produce parts of the final product, it can already be used to quickly prototype styles, stories, designs, moods, etc. A good chunk of the unnamed behind-the-scenes-people will loose their job.<p>Phase 2: While generative AI is still expensive, the output quality is sufficient to directly produce parts of / the entire final product. Big production outlets will use it to produce AAA titles and blockbusters. Even actors, directors and other high publicity positions will be replaced.<p>Phase 3: The production cost will sink further until it becomes attainable by smaller studios and indie productions. The already fierce markets will be completely flooded with more and more quantity over quality. Advertisement will not be pre-produced and cut into videos anymore but become very subtle product placements, impossible for ad-blockers to strip from the product.<p>Phase 4: Once the production cost falls below the price of one copy of the product, we will get completely customized entertainment products tailored to our personal taste. Online communities will emerge which craft skeletons / templates which then are filled out by the personal parameter sets of the consumers. That way you can still share the experience with friends even though everybody experiences a different variation.<p>Phase 5: As consumers do not hit any production limits any more (e.g. binge watch their favorite series ad infinitum) and the product becomes optimized to be maximally addictive by measuring their reaction to it, it will become impossible for most human beings to resist. The entertainment mania will reach its peak and social isolation, health issues and economic factors will bring down the human reproduction rate to basically zero.<p>Phase 6: Human civilization collapsed within one or two generations and the only survivors will be extremely technology-adverse people by selection. AGI might have happened in the meantime but did not have the time to gracefully take over and remodel the human infrastructure to become self sufficient. Instead a strict religion will rule the lands and the dark ages begin anew.<p>Note that none of this is new, it is just the continuation and intensification of already existing trends. This is also not AGI doomerism as it does not involve a malicious AGI gone rouge or anything like that. It is simply what happens when human nature meets powerful technology.<p>TLDR: While I love the technology I can only see very negative long-term outcomes from this.",

      "text": "I hope this doesn't get buried...<p>As several others have pointed out, realism of these models will continue to improve, and will soon be economically useful for producing beautiful or functional artifacts - however prompt adherence (getting what you want or intend) of the models is growing much more slowly.<p>However I think we have a long ways to go before we'll see a decent \"AI Film\" that tells a compelling story - and this has nothing to do with some sort of naturalistic fallacy that appeals to some innate nature of humans!<p>It comes down to the dataset and the limits of human creators in their ability to communicate their process.  Image-Text and Video-Text pairs are mostly labeled by semi-skilled humans who describe what they see in detail.  They are, for the most part, very good at capturing the obvious salient features of an image or a video. \"reflections of the neon lights glisten in the sidewalk\".  However, what you see in a movie scene is the sum total of dozens if not hundreds of influences, large and subtle.  Choices made by the actors, camera operators, lighting designers, sound designers, costuming, makeup, editors, etc...  Most people are not trained to recognize these choices at all, or might not even be aware that there are choices to make. We (simply) see \"Joaqin Phoenix is making awkward small-talk in the elevator with other office workers\".<p>So much of what we experience processes on subconscious and emotional and purely sensory levels, we don't elevate those lower-level qualia to our higher-brain's awareness and label them with vocabulary without intentional training (such as tasting wine, coffee, beer, etc - developing a palate is an act of sensory-vocabulary alignment).<p>However, despite not raising these things to our intentional awareness, it has an influence on us -- often the desired impact of the person who made that choice in the first place.  The overall effect of all of these intentional choices makes things 'feel right'.<p>There's no fundamental reason AI can't produce an output that has the same effect as those choices, however finding each little choice is like a needle in a haystack.  Accurate labeling of the training data tells the AI where to look -- but the people labeling the data are probably not well-versed in all of the little intentional choices that can be made when creating a piece of video-media.<p>Beyond the issue of the labeling folks being trained in the art itself, there's the problem too of the artists themselves not being able to fully articulate their (numerous, little, snowflake-into-avalanche) choices - or simply not articulating it even if they could.  Ask Jackson Pollock about paint viscosity and you'll learn a great deal, but ask about abstract painting composition and there's this ineffable gap that language seems ill-suited to cross.  The painter paints what they feel, and they hope that feeling is conveyed to the viewer - but you'd be hard pressed to recreate \"Autumn Rhythm (Number 30)\" if you had to transmit the information via language and hope they interpreted it correctly.  Art is simultaneously vague and specific!<p>So, to sum up the problem of conveying your intent to the model:<p>- The training data labels capture obvious or salient features, but not choices only visible to the trained eye<p>- The material itself is created by human artists who might not even be able to explain all of their choices in words<p>- You the prompter might not have the vocabulary that captures succinctly and specifically the intended effect<p>- The end result will necessarily be not quite what you imagined in your mind's eye as a result of  all of this missing information<p>You can still get good results if you tell it to copy something, because the label \"Tarantino\" captures a lot of detail, even all the little things you and the training data would never have labeled in words.  But it won't be yours and - until we have an army of trained artists providing precise descriptions for training data in their area of expertise, and you know how to speak those artists' language - it can't be yours.",

Join others in that effort. That’s the reason society has hope — not the people shrugging as people fall by the wayside.<p>Depression mediation by agency feels more positive, but I don’t have a lot of experience tbh. Just a view that we, technologists, shouldn’t abdicate responsibility nor encourage others to do so.<p>That culture, imo, is why a large section of tech workers, consumers and commentators see the industry in a bad light. They’re not wrong.<p>EDIT: to add, “what problems can I personally solve” also individualises society’s ability to shape itself for the better. “What problems can I personally get involved in solving”, “what communities are trying to solve problems I care about” is perhaps the message I’d advocate for.",

It was amazing how it felt like I could rewire my thought patterns over the course of a few months.<p>The main takeaway from it all however, was the mantra: _<i>thoughts are not facts</i>_.<p>If you can realize that your thoughts are not objective truths, you will be much better off in almost every aspect of your life, because after living this mantra for many years, putting it to the test constantly, I know it's solid.<p>Later on I read a lot of Buddhist philosophy which matched incredibly well with the therapy because a lot of Buddhist thinking and meditation practice is quite similar in it's approach. This sort of reinforced the validity of the CBT because I realized wise people have known about seeing things in an objective light for millennia, which was validating for me and helped me continue on the introspective path.<p>Basically, we're all hallucinating in one way or another, almost all of the time, and that is ok, just be aware of that. When we're worried about the future, we're worried about something which doesn't yet exist, which is actually crazy.<p>Of course it doesn't mean we should just ignore long term problems, no one advocates for that. But we shouldn't assume we know the outcome in advance because that often causes stress.<p>Warning: I think that for most westerners, it's \"safer\" to get into something like CBT, Buddhism comes with some IMO very confronting ideas for a lot of people where as CBT is much more user friendly for westerners.",

I will also add that with change and uncertainty, it’s difficult for us to imagine how banal things can ultimately turn out to be.<p>For example, I’m getting text messages all day long from random politicians asking for money. If you told people 50 years ago that one day we’d be carrying devices where we could be pinged with unwanted solicitations all day and night, they might have imagined an asphyxiating nightmare. But in reality, it’s mainly a nuisance.<p>The point is that your brain makes all kinds of emotional predictions about the future, but they aren’t really very useful and if you’re experiencing depression or anxiety, I can guarantee they are biased predictions.",

What I did not love (and partly why I left the industry) was the difficulty of getting paid decently at the bottom tier; I had the bad timing to come in right as the bottom was beginning to fall out of the indie market and making straight-to-video b-movies 3 or 4 times a year ceased to be a viable business model.<p><i>I think you might have it a little backwards. For most people, the fun part is \"making a movie\", not \"watching hundreds and hundreds of hours of footage picking between 10 different shots\". That's the drudgery, and that's the part generative AI can eliminate.</i><p>No, that's the craft, and solving problems where the continuity doesn't line up, or production had to drop shots, or the story as shot and written sucks in some way, is where the art comes in.<p>The drudgery is things like ingesting all the material, sorting it into bins, lining up slate cues, dealing with timecode errors, rendering schedules, working your way through long lists of deliverables and so on. You have literally confused the logistics part with the creative act.",

If you want to go above and beyond and craft the perfect shot, that opportunity would still be available to you. Why would it not?<p>When we invented machines that make clothes, did that reduce the number of jobs in the clothing industry? When we got better and better at it, did that make fashion worse? No. If you want a machine made suit for $50, you can find one. If you want a handmade suit for $5000, you can find one.<p>Tech like this expands opportunities, it does not eliminate them. If and when it gets to the point where Sora is better at making videos than a human in every conceivable dimension, then we can have this discussion and bemoan our loss.

It's difficult to find longitudinal data at the global level, but we can look at the impact of previous innovations (from outsourcing to manufacturing technology) on the US clothing market; employment there has fallen by nearly 90% over 30 years: <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/242729/number-of-employees-in-the-us-apparel-manufacturing-industry/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.statista.com/statistics/242729/number-of-employe...</a><p>The usual response to observations like this is 'well who wants to work in the clothing industry, those people are now free to do other things, great opportunity for people in other parts of the world etc.', but the the constant drive to lower prices by cutting labor costs or quality has big negative externalities. Lots of people that used to make a living thanks to their skill with a sewing machine, at least in the US, are no longer able to monetize that and had to switch to something else; chances they were less skilled at that other thing (or they'd have been doing it instead) and so suffered an economic loss while that transition was forced upon them.",

I think it will just bring more sublte propaganda for state actors, more subtle advertising for megacorps, the dieing of creative jobs like graphic artists or actors is just a sad sideeffect (these will still exist, but only as high end -- we will always have real AAA actors, but the days of extras on movie sets are counted -- lots of the Hollywood protests were because studios started doing contracts for noname actors that stated that the studio will regain rights of the actor's digital likeness)",

However the problem is what if everyone loses their current opportunities before these techs become widely available? How to handle the transition period? A monopoly/oligopoly is not going to care about helping the average person in accomplishing that transition, because it won't make their next quarterly earnings report look pretty.",

              "text": "<i>Filmmakers being able to bring their vision to life using generative models is going to create such a huge expansion of the market.</i><p>Of what market? Certainly not film production. I have my doubts about whether it will expand the market for films, in the economic sense. The lower the cost of producing and distributing a film, the lower the monetary value people will place on it.<p>Look how most music artists are no longer able to survive on royalties, and a few massive streaming companies have an astounding profitable oligopoly of consumers' music interest. Yes, many pre-streaming publishers were exploitative or unethical, but I'm not convinced that it was to a greater degree than the current market leaders. Consider also that the streaming revolution steamrolled many, perhaps most, indie record labels that supported niche genres; some live on but are no longer able to sustain physical output and a reduced to being digital marketing companies.<p>Now, people will continue to tell stories and entertain others, so technology like this will be good for people with an artistic vision who can't easily access publishers for whatever reason. It will certainly allow people to pursue bold artistic visions that would not otherwise be economically feasible - exotic locations, spectacular special effects, technically complex perspective moves. Those are good things; I worked in the film industry for a long time and have several unproduced scripts that I'd like to apply this technology to, so I'm not rejecting it.<p>However, more content doesn't necessarily translate into more economic activity; I think it very likely that visual media will be further devalued as a result. People who have spent years or a lifetime developing genuine craft will be told to abandon it in favor of giving suggestions to a computer system, and those who don't will be laughed at or suspected of fakery, because fakery is so widespread these days (Relevant recent example:  <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39379073\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39379073</a>). The easier it becomes to make something, the less value the market will assign to it; rational from the abstracted perspective of pure price theory, disastrous in real life.<p>Increasingly, we seem to be tilting towards a Huxley-esque dystopia of stunning and infinite-feeling virtual worlds to which we can escape on demand, and an increasingly shitty real world marked by the brutal economic logic of total resource and information exploitation. Already a stock rejoinder to complaints about the state of things is that humanity is on paper richer than ever before, to the point that bums have smartphones and anyone can afford an xbox. I have a homeless neighbor who's living in his car, spending his dying years watching YouTube on his phone to fall asleep because he's lonely. Technically this is an expansion of the market, but I don't think it's a good outcome.",

That was already replacing typesetters working with lead, and the people sorting the used lead, and working with inks etc. They still needed a past-up artist and more. Eventually the GUI based computer arrived, with PageMaker, Quark, Indesign etc. These days she is super productive with a massive online icon library available, full printing and distribution capabilities. Able to do a job that could have involved half a dozen or more people previously.<p>Are those people unemployed now? Not really (we are talking 1.5 generation now, so not the same people). Unemployment levels are low, and the workforce is significantly larger, with men and women working. The working (outside of the home) part of the population has gone up significantly over a few generations, despite all the new enabling productive tech.<p>What I see is a lot of visually higher quality work being delivered, but often with the same core content. So productivity has increased, but you get a glossy new shiny report in a PDF, instead of a photocopy of a typewritten page. (Yes, I do simplify. But I think you get the gist.)<p>2) I started as a system admin, the a systems analyst, worked through project manager, etc. until I was leading startups. In the space where I work now, circular economy and food production, there is so much work to do, that any AI support we can get is welcome. But as the work is innovative, new and not done before, most often the AI tools aren’t that useful, yet. That may change, but with a society that needs to replace a significant part of the infrastructure and processes to achieve a long term sustainable society, I actually don’t worry the AI tools will take my job or any of my colleagues job away. There is plenty to do. I have enough new things in front of me that I could probably keep a whole big venture fund occupied for a long time.",

Then I believe that higher-end restaurants will STILL be employing humans, as it will be perceived as more expensive, more sophisticated, therefore worth a premium price. What if robot cooks cook better and faster than human cooks? Then higher-end restaurants will probably have human cooks supervising robot cooks to correct their occasional errors, thereby still providing a service superior to cheaper restaurants using robot cooks only.",

There seems to be no sense of urgency or even medium-term thinking in stopping Putin, and Article 5 appears to be becoming less sacrosanct by the minute. Society is increasingly divided, with absolutely no attempt to find common ground (particularly evident in my demographic) and the majority of my generation having a miniscule (and shrinking) attention span through their direct stream of Chinese propaganda.

Science marches on, with a steady stream of interesting discoveries.<p>And programming is great - for now. It feels slightly strange spending a week writing a project that may be finished with a single prompt in a few year's time, but it's enjoyable.<p>Maybe I'm overreacting?

If we keep flipping that switch and approaching a point where everything is being produced with almost no human effort, does it become bad all of a sudden?<p>Somehow we'd need to distribute all this production, I'm not sure how it would work out, but just going from what we have now to half or 25% of effort needed is probably an improvement, at least I'd take that.",

That's how computer-generated animation is done today, which humans driving. Most of those steps have already been automated to some degree.<p>Early attempts to do animation by morphing sort of worked, and were prone to some of the same problems that 2D generative AI systems have. The intermediate frames between the starting and ending positions did not obey physical constraints.<p>This is a good problem to work on, because it leads to a more effective understanding of the real world.",

It's the thought that <i>every</i> single pixel, <i>every</i> movement is fake. There is literally not a speck of truth in these videos, there is nothing one can learn about the real world. Yes they're often \"right\" but any detail can be wrong at any moment. Just like ChatGPT hallucinating but in a much deeper way- we know that language can be used to lie or just make up things, but a realistic video hits in a different way. For example the video of the crested pigeon- a bird I haven't seen before- is beautiful and yet it can be wrong in an infinity of details- actually, I don't even know if such a bird exists.",

When you give it a prompt and it spits out a pretty image, remember that the range of acceptable outputs is very large in that context. It demos very well but it’s not useful outside of stock image/stock video use cases. What artists and engineers actually do is work under a rigorous set of constraints. Getting these models to do a very specific thing, correctly adhere to those constraints, and still maintain photorealism (or whatever style you need) is a very much unsolved problem.

Capitalism depends on a minimum money velocity where paradoxically if you collect 100% of the money, it becomes completely worthless.<p>To me, it seems guaranteed that will be drastic changes. There will be many attempts at new ways of organizing society with successes and failures along the way.

Consequently, the cost of any product or service that requires human labor is expected to trend toward zero.<p>We're already witnessing this with the creation of textual and graphical content through ChatGPT. It's now possible to generate various types of text content and a wide range of graphics at the cost of 10 cents for the dozen ChatGPT API calls. And the work is completed in a few minutes, as opposed to several hours. This represents a several orders of magnitude increase in per capita productivity for these specific tasks. As AI technology advances, the scope of applications benefiting from such productivity boosts is expected to widen, which means human civilization will experience a revolutionary increase in productivity, and with it, resource abundance.",

I'm a bit of an odd duck because I came to the Bible after having been a practicing Buddhist for several years and generally being unexposed to Christianity (save for a lukewarm exposure to Jesuit Catholicism) or any religion growing up.<p>Having lived a mostly-secular life and only later (at age ~30) coming to Christianity, I can confidently say that in regard to reality, it's taught me that it's highly subjective. What most people consider as \"reality\" is just the interpretation of what they see that keeps them from losing their mind. For some, reality is being an unhinged hedonist, for others it's planting a garden, and for others it's generally just \"trying to be nice and getting along.\"<p>Personally, God/Christ (and by extension, what's recorded in the Bible) is the interpretation of reality that makes the most sense to me. In practice/study, I've found that it maps 1:1 with what I see while also filling in the blanks on things I can't explain (e.g., the ability for the human body to heal itself, the pace/behavior of nature, or humanity's unrelenting drive to destroy what it doesn't/refuses to understand).",

Therefore also new industries are created. History rhymes, the ruling fears in such times have always been similar. Claims are being made but without any reasonable theories, expertise or provable facts (e.g. Goldman Sachs unemployment prediction is absolute bs). This is even more true when such related AI matters are thought about in more detail. Furthermore, even though employing tens of millions of people probably, only a few industries like content creation, movie etc. are affected. The affacted workforce of these industries is highly creative, as they are being paid for their job. The set of jobs today is big, they won't become cleaning staff nor homeless.<p>This technology has also to proof itself (Its technical potential is unlimited but financially limited by the size of funds being invested, and these are limited)<p>Transition to the use of such tools in corporations could take years, depending on the type and size and other parameters. People underestimate the inefficiencies that a lot of companies embody - and I am only talking about the US and some parts of Europe here. If a company did their job for 2 decades the same way, a sudden switch does not happen overnight. Affected people have ways to transition to other industries, educate themselves further and much more. Especially as someone living in the west, the opportunities are huge. And in addition, the wide array of different variables about the economy and the earth, and everything its differing societies are, comes into play: Some corporations want real videos made by real people; Some companies want to stay the way they are and compete using their traditional methods; Corporations are still going to hire ad agencies - ad agencies whose workflow his now much more efficient and more open to new creative spheres which benefits both customer and themselves. They list could go one endlessly.<p>Lots of people seem to fear or think about the alleged sole power OpenAI COULD achieve. But would that be a problem, would \"another Alphabet\" be a problem? Hundreds of millions of people benefited and are benefiting today from their products. They have products that are reliable and work (This forum consisting of tech experts is a niche case, nearly all people don't care at all if data on them is being used for commercial purposes). Google had a patent guaranteed monopoly on search. But here we have: an almost non patented or patentable market, an open source community, other companies of all sizes competing, innovation happening and much more. It is true that companies like OpenAI have more funds available to spend than others, but such circumstances have always driven competition and innovation. And at the end of the day, customers are still going to use the best product they have decided to be so.<p>I know I may be stating the obvious but: The economy and the world is a chaos system with a unpredictable future to come.",
